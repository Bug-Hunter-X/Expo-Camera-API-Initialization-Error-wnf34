# Expo Camera API Initialization Error

This repository demonstrates a common error encountered when using the Expo Camera API: attempting to access camera features before the camera has properly initialized.  The code in `cameraBug.js` shows this issue, and `cameraBugSolution.js` provides a corrected implementation.

## Problem

The problem is that the component tries to use the camera before it's ready, leading to errors or undefined behavior.  This is frequently due to improper asynchronous handling of camera initialization.

## Solution

The solution is to ensure that all camera operations occur only after the camera has fully initialized.  This can be done using the `cameraRef`'s `getStatusAsync()` method, which provides feedback about the current state of the camera.
